# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a sorting visualizer that demonstrates various sorting algorithms through a visual representation. Users can interact with the visualizer to see how different algorithms sort an array of numbers.

## Getting Started

To run the sorting visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sorting-visualiser
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the sorting visualizer.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

This visualizer includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Each algorithm is visualized step-by-step, allowing users to see how the array is sorted in real-time.
